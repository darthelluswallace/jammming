A project for learning and exploring JS

The codeacademy captsone project for learning React/JS front-end. 

Prerequistes: Create an account and get an apikey/client id for the Spotify Web API and OpenWeather API.

It uses the Spotify Search API and implicit grant to allow a user to create and save a playlist.

I'm always trying to learn/add more functionality, so working on some other features, including weather based song recommendations (still figuring that one out).
